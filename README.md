# Career Assistant
Search for careers in list of scrapped company careers' page

## Introduction

We all know getting a referral or applying directly on career site directly has the most chances of getting a interview call
But we all know how painful it is to remember all the company names and goto their career site and apply
So, in order to solve this problem, I started this project Career Assistant
